The model consists of crop classification, disease detection, and disease classification. In the first step, a crop classification model was developed using healthy and diseased leaf images of the three crops. The model was trained and validated using five pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models, and the EfficientNet architecture showed the highest accuracy of 99.33%. The model was then used to detect diseases in individual crops in the second step. Three individual disease detection models were developed for bell pepper, potato, and tomato, and the GoogLeNet, VGG19, and ResNet50 models showed the highest accuracy for each crop, respectively. The models achieved high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, ranging from 99.75% to 100.00%.
