🤖 GenAI — Advanced Generative AI Toolkit
ChainAI is an open-source Generative AI framework designed to simplify the process of creating, fine-tuning, and deploying powerful generative models for tasks like text generation, summarization, paraphrasing, and human-like content creation. It’s built for developers, researchers, and content creators who want control and customization over GenAI workflows.

🚀 Key Features
🧠 Text Generation: Generate human-like responses using state-of-the-art transformer models (GPT, LLaMA, Mistral, etc.)

✍️ Paraphrasing & Summarization: Rephrase or condense large text into shorter, meaningful content.

🧾 AI Writing Assistant: Interactive mode for writing suggestions, grammar correction, and idea generation.

🧪 Prompt Engineering Ready: Easily test and compare prompts and model responses.

📊 Evaluation Metrics: Includes BLEU, ROUGE, and perplexity metrics to measure generation quality.

⚙️ Fine-tuning Support: Tools to fine-tune your own generative models on custom datasets.
